* Core Functionality [0/4]
** TODO [#A] Issue 1: File-Based Storage Implementation
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT:   16:00
:END:

*** User Story
As a user who values text-based workflows,
I need a system that stores flashcards as Markdown files in regular directories
So that I can easily edit, track, and back up my knowledge base with standard tools.

*** Details and Assumptions
- Each card should be stored as a single Markdown file
- Files should follow the specified format with YAML frontmatter and Question/Answer sections
- Directory structure should represent deck hierarchy
- Changes to files should be reflected in the application

*** Acceptance Criteria
#+BEGIN_SRC gherkin
Given the application is running
When I create a new card through the application
Then a properly formatted Markdown file should be created in the specified directory

Given a properly formatted Markdown file exists in the watched directory
When I launch the application
Then the card should be loaded and available for review

Given I make changes to a card file using an external text editor
When the application is running or restarted
Then those changes should be reflected in the card's content
#+END_SRC

*** Implementation Notes
- Create Card struct with required fields
- Implement file reading/writing functions
- Support YAML frontmatter parsing
- Add basic markdown parsing
- Create file path handling utilities

*** Related Issues
None

** TODO [#A] Issue 2: Implement SM-2 Spaced Repetition Algorithm
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT:   8:00
:END:

*** User Story
As a learner,
I need an efficient spaced repetition system
So that I can optimize my memory retention and learning efficiency.

*** Details and Assumptions
- Implement the SM-2 algorithm similar to Anki
- Track review intervals, last review date, and difficulty in file metadata
- Support 0-5 rating system for card difficulty
- Calculate next review date based on performance

*** Acceptance Criteria
#+BEGIN_SRC gherkin
Given I am reviewing a card
When I rate it with a difficulty score of 0-5
Then the review interval should be calculated according to SM-2 algorithm

Given a card has been reviewed previously
When I open the application on a future date
Then I should only see cards that are due for review

Given I review a card successfully multiple times
When I continue using the application
Then the interval between reviews should increase appropriately
#+END_SRC

*** Implementation Notes
- Research SM-2 algorithm implementation details
- Add interval calculation functions
- Integrate with card metadata
- Add review history tracking

** TODO [#A] Issue 14: Implement Real-time File Watching with fsnotify
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT:   8:00
:END:

*** User Story
As a user who edits flashcards with external text editors,
I need GoCard to automatically detect and reload cards when they change on disk
So that I can seamlessly work with my preferred editor and see changes immediately in the application.

*** Details and Assumptions
- Users may edit, create, or delete card files outside the application
- We need to monitor the entire directory tree recursively
- Changes should be detected in near real-time
- The application needs to handle various file events:
  - Creation of new card files
  - Modification of existing card files
  - Deletion of card files
  - File renaming
  - Moving files between directories
- The current implementation has a placeholder for file watching that needs to be implemented

*** Acceptance Criteria
#+BEGIN_SRC gherkin
Given I have GoCard running
When I create a new markdown file in the watched directory using an external editor
Then the application should detect the new file and add it to the card collection

Given I have GoCard running
When I modify the content of an existing card file using an external editor
Then the application should detect the change and update the card in memory

Given I have GoCard running
When I delete a card file using an external text editor or file manager
Then the application should detect the deletion and remove the card from memory

Given I have GoCard running
When I rename a card file using an external application
Then the application should handle this correctly by removing the old card and adding the new one

Given I have multiple levels of subdirectories
When I add, modify, or delete files in any subdirectory
Then the application should correctly detect and handle these changes
#+END_SRC

*** Implementation Notes
- Use the fsnotify package to watch for file system events
- Implement recursive directory watching (fsnotify only watches a single directory by default)
- Add debouncing to prevent duplicate events (files being saved may trigger multiple events)
- Handle edge cases like:
  - Files being edited while the application is loading
  - Temporary files created by text editors
  - Moving files between watched directories
- Ensure efficient processing of file events to avoid performance issues
- Consider adding a configuration option to enable/disable file watching

** TODO [#A] Issue 15: Implement Deck Organization through Directory Structure
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT:   16:00
:END:

*** User Story
As a GoCard user,
I need to organize my flashcards into logical groupings (decks) using directories
So that I can manage my learning materials by topic, difficulty, or other classification schemes.

*** Details and Assumptions
- Directories in the file system should represent decks in the application
- Subdirectories should represent sub-decks (nested organization)
- Users should be able to:
  - Create new decks (directories)
  - Move cards between decks
  - View cards by deck
  - Get statistics per deck
  - Filter review sessions by deck
- The directory structure is already partially supported in the file loading logic
- Need to add explicit deck management features to the application

*** Acceptance Criteria
#+BEGIN_SRC gherkin
Given I am using the application
When I create a new deck
Then a new directory should be created in the file system

Given I have multiple decks
When I select a specific deck
Then I should only see cards from that deck and its sub-decks

Given I am viewing a card
When I move it to a different deck
Then the card's file should be moved to the corresponding directory

Given a nested directory structure exists
When I load the application
Then the deck hierarchy should match the directory structure

Given I have cards in various decks
When I start a review session
Then I should be able to filter the session to specific decks

Given I have multiple decks
When I view statistics
Then I should be able to see statistics broken down by deck
#+END_SRC

*** Implementation Notes
- Extend the current CardStore to track deck information
- Add methods for creating, renaming, and deleting decks
- Implement deck selection and filtering in the UI
- Ensure moving cards between decks handles file operations correctly
- Make sure file paths are updated correctly when cards are moved
- Consider adding deck metadata (perhaps as a special .deck.md file in each directory)
- Implement proper error handling for file operations across directories
- Consider platform-specific path handling for cross-platform compatibility
- Add a visual representation of the deck hierarchy in the UI

*** Example Structures
Current:
#+BEGIN_SRC
CardStore
└── map[filepath]*Card
#+END_SRC

Proposed:
#+BEGIN_SRC
CardStore
├── map[filepath]*Card  // All cards
└── map[deckPath]*Deck  // Organized by deck

Deck
├── Name           // Deck name (directory name)
